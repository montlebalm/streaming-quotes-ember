# Streaming Stocks with Ember

This is an example of how you can simulate real-time stock updates using
Ember.

# Impressions of Ember

## Pros

- **Convention**: common use cases have been codified into the framework,
  which takes the guess work out of many architectural decisions. Once you
  know learn "The Ember Way" you can really fly through development.
- **ember-cli**: no fuss project template with asset compilation, local
  server, and [livereload](https://github.com/napcs/node-livereload) in
  seconds. You could do this yourself on any other project, but the cli
  makes starting new projects delightful.
- **Community**: Ember users are fewer in number, but they make up for it
  in thoughtfulness. The official [Ember
  forums](http://discuss.emberjs.com) are filled with helpful discussions
  and quick to reply to questions.
- **ES6**: though not a feature of Ember, the ember-cli
  supports ES6 by default.

## Cons

- **Learning curve**: Ember has the steepest learning curve of any
  frontend framework I've used. It's often difficult to know where .
- **Lack of choice**: the heavy use of convention means you're in for
  trouble if you go against the grain. Embrace "The Ember Way" or look
  elsewhere.
